# Explanation
Usually to approximate function you have to solve system of n-polynom equasions, to find right coefficients for your approximating n-polynom, or rather use Lagrange's method. 
But what this code does is it solves the system with genetic selection method, so you don't have to do all the hard math by yourself :D
